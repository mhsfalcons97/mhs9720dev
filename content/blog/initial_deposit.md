Don't forget to send in those cruise forms today!

**FYI** - if you do not that **does not** mean that you can't still go on the cruise, it just means that you'll have to pay a largers deposit of $150 per person.

I also had a great talk with Aleta Danley at Breakaway Travel and she gave me some excellent details on extra fees to keep in mind as we prepare to head out.

1. The gratuity fee listed on the paperwork is $12 per person, per day and we can choose to pay that $48 up front, or have it billed at the cruise.
2. There are a couple of other fees to be aware of: 

  - **The Bottomless Bubble Drink Program** | $6 per person, per day
      - Unlimited soda and juice 
  - **The Cheers Program** | $49.95 per person, per day 
      - Alcohol *adults only*
